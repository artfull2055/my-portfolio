<h2>Welcome to My Personal Website</h2>

<p>Welcome to my personal site! This website brings together some of the things I enjoy the most are 
<strong>Sports</strong>, <strong>Music</strong>, and <strong>Criminal Justice</strong>. Each page shares simple facts, favorite topics, and why these areas interest me.</p>

<p>I’ve always had a strong interest in <strong>sports</strong>, especially boxing and martial arts because they teach discipline and mental focus. I also am a big fan of football due to the thrill of the game.
<strong>Music</strong> inspires me daily and helps me relax, concentrate, or lift my mood. 
<strong>Criminal justice</strong> fascinates me because it shows how fairness, ethics, and law shape our society.</p>
